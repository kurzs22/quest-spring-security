# Spring Security

## Challenge
## Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division


Well done, I knew you were the right person for the job. I can now tell you about your mission. SHIELD has discovered unsecured accesses on its web platform. The director wants to redesign the whole project, and asked me to entrust the task of creating a POC to someone I trust. You will be expected to create routes according to the following criteria:
- / This route is accessible to everyone, without authentication, and returns the message "Welcome to the SHIELD".
- /avengers/assemble This route is only accessible to SHIELD heroes, and returns the message "Avengers..... Assemble".
- /secret-bases This page is only accessible to the SHIELD director, and returns the list of every city where there happens to be a Wild Code School (look this page to help you).

Your mission is to create logins for the following users.

Create names, passwords, and roles for: Steve Guy, Tony Stark, Nick Fury.

## Validation criterias
- The project includes the requested routes.
- Ids allow access to the appropriate secure routes.
- The code is available on GitHub.
